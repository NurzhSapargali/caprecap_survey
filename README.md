# Estimating the Size of a Population through Repeated Sampling: a Survey Sampling View on Capture-recapture Procedures

This repository contains the code as well as the datasets used in the paper Estimating the Size of a Population through Repeated Sampling: a Survey Sampling View on Capture-recapture Procedures (Sapargali and Kauermann). It contains scripts to recreate the estimation and plots in the paper.

`estimate_N.R` is a script file from the [website](https://www.capturerecapture.co.uk/) of the Analysis of Capture-recapture Data book (McCrea & Morgan) with slight modifications. See the paper for more details.
