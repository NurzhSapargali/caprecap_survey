## Simulated data used in "Estimating the Size of a Population through Repeated Sampling: a Survey Sampling View on Capture-recapture Procedures"

The simulated data used to compare the performance of the proposed and alternative estimators are given in the folders `alpha_0.5` and `alpha_2.0`. The data given in files in the respective folders are represented as a jagged array with each row being a list of IDs of individuals sampled. For details on the simulation, refer to the paper.
